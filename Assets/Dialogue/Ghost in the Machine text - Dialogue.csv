But as we were standing in the pantry, he didn't look brave. He was rattling like a pepper grinder. It was horrible, seeing him like that. I told him I could put some rat poison in Hume and Rousseau's soup. Minestrone today—they always licked their bowls clean. But I could see the annoyance in his face. ""They're not going to stop for soup, Bert. Not when they're busy trying to murder me."" It was the first time he'd called me that. I'd prove I could be brave for the both of us.

But then I found Rousseau there, filling Immanuel's head with all sorts of ideas! Rousseau tried to confuse me, saying Mr. Descartes was dangerous. I didn't believe them, of course, but I pretended. I could hardly keep my voice from shaking. I told them the soup was on, to follow me to the kitchen. But Mr. Descartes was right—they were too busy with murder on their mind. I don't know why they didn't kill me when they had a chance. Maybe they were obsessed with killing Mr. Descartes. I still can't believe Immanuel believed them over me.

It had to be Rousseau and Hume shooting at Mr. Descartes, so I went running into the hall. But ... it was horrible. It wasn't Rousseau at all. They were sprinting away in terror, and Mr. Descartes was the one with the gun. Immanuel was on the ground in front of Mr. Descartes's office, still holding his mop. I raced to him and tried to get him to lift his head. But he wasn't breathing. Mr. Descartes stood there, looking at me under hooded eyes. I stood and backed away. Mr. Descartes stepped forward, and with both hands, shoved me backwards. I felt a snap of caution tape, my body falling, my vision tunnelling to black as I fell. Did that really happen? Am I ...

My parents only took me seriously when there was something they could get from me. I'd pour my heart into letters, sprinkle them with vanilla, and they'd hologram me back asking for money.

I shot out the lock and broke in, and pulled out the gun. I was going to kill him. Descartes Power was a big corporation. They could do stuff like throw people out of their homes. I couldn't let that happen. But I hesitated, and then suddenly Bertrand was there. He must have heard me gunshot. He tried to take the gun from me and we stumbled into the filing cabinet.

He said that my family would die, even if I told people. There was no stopping it. The GRAPS would be activated no matter what. But if I stayed quiet, he would get me and my family out. I agreed. I agreed to let everyone else die because I love my family. They're all I have, and they're the ones that depend on me, not everyone else.

It's like talking to a bunch of flightless drones. That's why why I didn't believe the boss when he took me aside with Bertrand, the cook. Me, Watson, and Bertrand, we're the only ones unimportant enough to be free of the network. The boss showed us footage of two GRAPS employees—the ghost tech and head engineer—collecting guns from the security office. I didn't believe the boss for a second.

,,Rousseau,,0,Y,Rousseau,I'm Rousseau. Ghost tech. I work with spectral energy. Or I was supposed to. So many things went wrong. It all happened so fast. Why did this happen?,,

,,Rousseau,1st lie: I don't need other people,1,Y,Lunch,I was eating lunch alone when everything went down. I always eat lunch alone. There's no reason to hang around with other people. I don't need them. I can take care of myself. Friends and family isn't something I'm interested in cultivating. ,,

,,Rousseau,1st lie confrontation,2,Y,Photo,"I was alone when I arrived on Aris, but I'm not anymore. Hume reached out to me. She was there for me. She was someone I could really talk to. I played with her kids. I wasn't alone anymore. The fact is, I didn't think I'd ever have a family, like other people did. But Hume gave that to me. When I saw her bleeding out in Rene's office... something broke inside me. I can't be alone again. I just can't. I need people.",,

,,Rousseau,2nd lie: I'm still alive,3,Y,Exposed spectral energy,"Hume and Immanuel were dead. I'd been shot. Everything was falling apart. But I had to hold it together. What the GRAPS would do was bigger than me. I had to destroy it, but Rene was still after me. He still had a gun. I took the long way around to the workshop. I'd be out in the open all the way there. I somehow got to the workshop before Rene, but disabling the device without causing a meltdown wasn't that simple. So Rene came into the room before I was done. I took cover and tried to take the gun from him when he got close. After that, everything happened so fast. We were on the ground, and his arm got caught in the exposed spectral energy and it just consumed his body. I can still smell the burnt flesh. But it's over now. The GRAPS isn't active anymore. Now I just have to go report everything that happened.",,

,,Rousseau,2nd lie confrontation,4,Y,Taser,"I had a taser. Hume had taken the gun. I knew Rene would come after me, so I hid and tried to get the jump on him. But I'm not made for this. I managed to knock the gun from his hands. But he managed to wrestle the taser from mine, and I watched it skitter under one of the tables. Then there was pain. I'd been nicked by spectral energy before, so I knew what had happened immediately. My eyes were focused on the taser, out of reach, and then... Well, I guess then I died.",,

,,Rousseau,3rd lie: Working with lucid ghost energy is fine.,5,Y,Lucid Ghosts,"I've worked with lucid spectral energy before. It's much more powerful than illucid. Some machines need that kind of juice. Some people don't like it when we use them. I understand. But those people are dead. What we do is for the living. Ghost tech does so much to improve the lives of people that are still living in places like Aris. It changes lives. Using lucid ghosts is a small price, and one I'm willing to pay for the greater good.",,

,,Rousseau,3rd lie confrontation,6,Y,Resignation,"I was working for Duality Technologies five years ago. They do a lot of R&D with lucid ghosts. It paid well, and it allowed me to do the stuff I liked doing. I had free reign. Good working conditions. But I resigned after a year. I just... I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't live with myself knowing that we're processing people on the verge of passing to the next life. I promised myself that I would never compromise on that moving forward. But then times got tough, and Descartes Power was hiring. I convinced myself that it would make life better for the people of Aris. I compromised again. Maybe... maybe I can be better in the next life, if I even deserve to go there.",,
