,,Bertrand,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,0,,Lucid0,... Are you the new grocer? Where's my broccoli? ...,,
,,Bertrand,,0,Y,Bertrand,"Hmm? Oh, I'm Bertrand. Just made some cinnamon rolls—we'll be friends as soon as you taste the icing. Vanilla bean, freshly scraped from the pod. Take a dozen! ",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Rene,"Mr Descartes? He runs this facility. Don't let the cold exterior fool you. He comes in here every morning for one of my famous berry lavender muffins. When he's mid-bite, it's the only time he looks peaceful. He's under so much pressure. Takes a lot of bravery to run this place. I'm glad I can offer him even a moment of happiness.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Hume,"I don't talk to her much, mostly because I don't know what she's saying most of the time. Everyone here talks in acronyms. She and Rousseau are usually together.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Rousseau,"Oh, Rousseau? They're one of the good ones. They always go out of their way to thank me. Even came in here to help sort dry beans and rocks the other day. But then that video from Mr Descartes...",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Locke,He's kind of scary. He doesn't even change facial expressions when eating. How can you trust someone who robotically eats chocolate mousse?,,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Immanuel,"Sometimes, I think he's on to something. He oddly makes sense when you listen to him for long enough. And he loves my grain loaf, eating the seeds one at a time. It's nice to be appreciated.",,
,,Bertrand,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,1,,Lucid1,Food storage for the porridge!,,
,,Bertrand,1st lie: Rene is the bravest boss ever,1,Y,Pantry,"Mr Descartes came to me all frantic, saying people were out to get him. He pulled me and the janitor behind the pantry door and whispered that Hume and Rousseau were after him. He showed us footage on his phone. They had guns and had already killed Locke, our building's security guard! I was terrified. These people I'd been working with, feeding, sleeping next to. Murderers? Mr Descartes was so brave. He must have battled his way out.",,
,,Bertrand,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,2,,Lucid2,"Yep, a dash of pepper, a pinch of arsen—I mean arugula!",,
,,Bertrand,1st lie confrontation: I poisoned the soup to protect Rene.,2,Y,Poison,"Mr Descartes always knows what to do. He's smart, in control, and I can tell he's passionate beneath the protective chill. But as we were standing in the pantry, he didn't look brave. He was rattling like a pepper grinder. It was horrible, seeing him like that. I told him I could put some rat poison in Hume and Rousseau's soup. Minestrone today—they always licked their bowls clean. But I could see the annoyance in his face. ""They're not going to stop for soup, Bert. Not when they're busy trying to murder me."" It was the first time he'd called me that. I'd prove I could be brave for the both of us. After he left, I got the rat poison out anyway.",,
,,Bertrand,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,3,,Lucid3,"Immanuel, don't do it!",,
,,Bertrand,2nd lie: I'm still alive.,3,Y,Bathroom stall,"I had to protect Mr Descartes from Hume and Rousseau. The murderers were running around in the halls! I went to find Immanuel in his bathroom stall, the one with all the clippings and red string. He knows the ins and outs of the whole complex, and I thought he might know a safe way around. But then I found Rousseau there, filling Immanuel's head with all sorts of ideas. Rousseau tried to confuse me, saying Mr Descartes was dangerous. I didn't believe them, of course, but I pretended. I could hardly keep my voice from shaking. Mr Descartes would never do something like that. I told them the soup was on, to follow me to the kitchen for lunch. But Mr Descartes was right—they were too busy with murder on their mind. I don't know why Rousseau didn't kill me when they had a chance. ...I still can't believe Immanuel believed Rousseau over me. I'm never making him a grain loaf again.",,
,,Bertrand,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,4,,Lucid4,But he called me Bert... I fell and fell.,,
,,Bertrand,2nd lie confrontation: Rene pushed me down the elevator shaft,4,Y,Elevator,"A huge bang, that's what I remember, and another right after that. It had to be Rousseau and Hume shooting at Mr Descartes, so I went running into the hall. But ... it was horrible. It wasn't Rousseau at all. They were sprinting away in terror, and Mr Descartes was the one with the gun. Immanuel was on the ground in front of Mr Descartes's office, still holding his mop. I raced to him and tried to get him to lift his head. But he wasn't breathing. Mr Descartes stood there, looking at me under hooded eyes. He'd never looked at me like that, like I was beneath him. I stood and backed away. Mr Descartes stepped forward, and with both hands, shoved me backwards. I felt a snap of caution tape, my body falling, my vision tunnelling to black as I fell. Did that really happen? Am I ... I'm really dead, aren't I?",,
,,Bertrand,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,5,,Lucid5,Best dish I ever made ...,,
,,Bertrand,3rd lie: Being liked by people is the most important thing.,5,Y,Lunch,"I was adopted, you know. My family was nice enough. Older brothers were smart. Always clapping back with something interesting. I wasn't in on the joke most of the time, but I was from a different planet. Looked different, spoke different. It couldn't be helped, how they picked on me. But when I found cooking, their faces! That was a place I understood, the feel of a salt pinch, a noseful of earthy oregano. I created experiences. I gave them my whole world in a bite, and that was everything.",,
,,Bertrand,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,6,,Lucid6,Every time I wrote home ...,,
,,Bertrand,3rd lie confrontation: They only loved me for what they could get from me.,6,Y,Hologram,"Ever feel like you'll just die if people don't like you? I've given myself to people one ingredient at a time, and now, there's nothing left: I can see through my skin. Dead, yes, but maybe I've been like this from the very beginning. My parents only paid me attention when there was something they could get from me. I was a status symbol to them, the amputee orphan from a different planet. When I started cooking professionally, I'd write home, pouring my heart into letters and sprinkling them with vanilla. They'd hologram me back asking for money. Mr Descartes was the same, in the end. Only wanted me for what he could take. I have advice, if you'll take it. Be kind. Make others feel seen.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Gun,There was... so much blood. Lavender muffin? Just came out of the oven!,,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Chef's knife,A dull knife is a dangerous knife.,,
,,Bertrand,,2,,Soup,"I ... I make a lot of soup. Don't know what you're on about. This vinegrette won't whisk itself, so if you'll excuse me...",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Statuette,"Mr Descartes's father! Well, I don't know how well he treated Mr Descartes, to be honest. He looked sad when I asked him about the statuette during my interview. He was surprised I noticed the resemblance.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Filing cabinet,"Nope, all my recipes are in my noggin! And the beauty is in the differences.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,GRAPS,Haven't heard of it. What's it taste like?,,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Office,"You're standing in it! Might not be as fancy as others, but it's all I need. Magic is in the making of things, not the tools.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Lucid ghosts,"I think I've heard Rousseau talk about them before to Hume, but I dunno. I try not to eavesdrop—ain't polite.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Computer,"Sometimes, I go into Locke's office and play Moondew Valley to get recipe ideas. And to help save Shale from himself.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Company,"Oh, I hardly know anything about it. I'm just here to reach people through their tastebuds. There are weird noises sometimes. A certain electricity in the air. But I just work here.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Mop,Immanuel's friend? I think it's possessed or something.,,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Extinction event,Immanuel spouts off on these kinds of things now and again. He pipes down if I feed him enough bread with lots of seeds.,,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Back of the head,"Has my hairnet slipped? That would be just my luck. It got tangled in my whisk the other day, and I didn't notice until it was already in the muffin batter.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Employee of the month,"Oh, that's not mine! Gotta perfect my craqueline recipe for my choux... maybe then.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Mother,"The sourdough starter? I know it's around here somewhere, but maybe it got into the radioactive waste. Had a dozen croissants walk out that door just last week.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Traces of blood,"Where, in here? Last thing I need is a health violation!",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Protect,"I don't know if I'd go that far, but food does make people feel safe. I hope I can offer them some form of protection, even if it's just within themselves.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Update,"Risotto is simmering, might need more garlic. Another fifteen minutes, maybe? Which table are you at?",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Broken door,I thought I heard a crash. Is Mr Descartes okay? Was he hurt?,,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Photo,"The ... the one in my pocket? How did you know? I swear, it's nothing. Mr Descartes has beautiful eyes, that's all.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Tickets,"Unless you're some transplanetary trillionaire and have your own ship, tickets are the only way on or off this planet. Even then, they're too expensive for most. Most everyone here is local.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Exposed spectral energy,Nothing like that around here. But I do put popping candy in my cupcakes sometimes. Party in your mouth!,,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Taser,I think Locke has one of those. Wouldn't want to get on his bad side.,,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Leftovers,"Today, it's a mushroom risotto and rocket salad. Want me to set some aside for ya? Found the mushrooms outside. They're glowing, but I think they're all right.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Resignation,"I guess I'll have to go somewhere else once my contract is up, but resign? Never. I wonder where Mr Descartes will go after this.",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Birdie,"I play badminton on the weekends, but I think it's mostly kneading dough that keeps me in shape. Maybe it's genetics. When Mr Descartes gave me a uniform, it was a bit small. Do you think that's a sign? Do you think he was disappointed when I asked for a bigger size? No, of course not ... can't believe I said that out loud!",,
,,Bertrand,,1,,Watercolor,"Can't say I've thought of it, but it might be too chalky. Maybe in a meringue? ",,
,,Hume,Confused answer 1,0,,When given a keyword they can't yet give an answer to,... The actuator is faulty. We'll have to replace it...,,

,,Hume,Confused answer 3,0,,When given a keyword they can't yet give an answer to,"... Watch your hands, that's pure spectral energy. It'll fry you inside out...",,
,,Hume,,0,Y,Hume,"I'm Hume, the engineer. I work on designs and stuff. Rousseau helps me with the spectral side of things. I think I'm pretty dependable, but everything happened so fast.",,
,,Hume,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,0,,Lucid0,Wh-what's going on? I can't remember anything. Who am I?,,
,,Hume,,5,,Rene,"Rene is my boss. He gave me a way out, and I took it. It was the only choice I had. He scares me a little. It's... I had no choice.",,
,,Hume,,1,,Rousseau,"They're the ghost technician, so we work together a lot. We were friends before then, and ate lunch together most days.",,Lunch
,,Hume,,5,,Locke,Rene killed Locke. I didn't think he'd go so far. I helped him drag his wrapped up body to the dumpster outside. Rousseau saw us. And then it was all over. Everything happened so fast after that. Rene told me to go take care of her. Kill her. And I almost did it.,,
,,Hume,,1,,Bertrand,"Bertrand's the cook. He didn't start until a week or two after I did. He seems very happy, but he's very serious about food. I don't like eating meat, but I didn't want to tell him, so I've been eating minestrone soup a lot.",,
,,Hume,,1,,Immanuel,"Immanuel talks about connections between things a lot. One time, he told me to my face that he thinks I'm part of a plot to control the population of Aris. I hope he doesn't think that anymore.",,
,,Hume,1st lie: The machine I helped build is safe and good,1,Y,GRAPS,"The Ghost Retrieval And Processing System. It's state of the art. It detects illucid ghosts and retrieves them from a distance. It's safer than sending people to bottle them, and it's faster. I'm pretty proud I played a part in setting it up here on Aris. It's safe and the design makes sense.",,
,,Hume,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,1,,Lucid1,I'm proud of that machine.,,
,,Hume,1st lie confrontation,2,Y,Extinction event,"I thought maybe something was off with the GRAPS. They said it would identify and target illucid ghosts, but there's no functionality for that. It looked like it just does it indiscriminately. And the batteries were massive. Way too big for the number of ghosts that are likely to appear on Aris in a hundred years. It's like Descartes Power was expecting some kind of extinction event. Or they weren't waiting for people to die first. But I don't know. I didn't want to bring it to Rene, 'cause I wasn't sure, so I put off for a few days.",,Company
,,Hume,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,2,,Lucid2,Something was strange about the GRAPS's design...,,
,,Hume,2nd lie: I am still alive,3,Y,Filing cabinet,"Rousseau and I split up after I told them everything. I went to find Rene, to tell him that I killed Rousseau, like he asked. I knocked on the open door, and told him. Straight face, no sweating. I was weirdly calm. He seemed relieved, but maybe still a bit jumpy. When I turned to go find Rousseau and help them destroy the GRAPS, I hit my elbow on the file cabinet, hard. So hard there was blood. Rene nearly leapt from his seat. I just laughed it off and hurried to the workshop.",,
,,Hume,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,3,,Lucid3,Should I come in tomorrow?,,
,,Hume,2nd lie confrontation,4,Y,Broken door,"Rene had locked the door when I got there. Somehow, he'd found out that I hadn't killed Rousseau. I didn't even think of breaking in, but then he started yelling. Saying that he was calling the Aris bank. That he'd make sure they tossed my family into the street. I just saw red. I broke the glass to open the door and pulled out the gun. I was going to kill him. Descartes Power was a big corporation. They could do stuff like throw people out of their homes. I couldn't let that happen. But I hesitated, and then suddenly Bertrand was there. He must have heard me gunshot. He tried to take the gun from me and we stumbled into the filing cabinet. There was a searing pain on the side of my head for a split second. Then there was nothing. I guess that means I'm dead.",,
,,Hume,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,4,,Lucid4,Wait... was it locked?,,
,,Hume,3rd lie: It's okay to do bad things to keep my family safe,5,Y,Tickets,"When I asked Rene about the GRAPS, he got very angry. I just stood there. He said that my family would die, even if I told people. There was no stopping it. The GRAPS would be activated no matter what. But if I stayed quiet, he would get me and my family out. I agreed. I agreed to let everyone else die because I love my family. They're all I have, and they're the ones that depend on me, not everyone else. I have to look out for them, even if it means hurting other people. A day later, we had tickets off-planet for the date of the GRAPS activation.",,
,,Hume,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,5,,Lucid5,My family will be safe.,,
,,Hume,3rd lie confrontation,6,Y,Photo,"Me and Rousseau go way back. After they resigned their high-end job, they came to Aris alone. We worked on some jobs together and we became friends. They came over for dinner. They played with my kids. We used to have beers after work in this pub on the south end of town. They told me that I was like the sister they never had. I laughed it off, but I felt it too. They were family. And I depended on them as much as they depended on me. I could talk to them about work, and about how worried I was about my finances. Stuff I couldn't tell anyone else. And I would have just left them behind. That's not right. It's not.",,Resignation
,,Hume,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,6,,Lucid6,My family... all of my family?,,
,,Hume,,5,,Gun,I'd taken a gun from the locker in the security room. Locke never locks it. Ironic. But... I didn't want to shoot anyone. At least not when I took it. I didn't even think I'd be able to use it. But we had to.,,
,,Hume,,1,,Chef's knife,I don't know anything about cooking. Bertrand has a big chef's knife that he uses to chop things up.,,
,,Hume,,1,,Elevator,I don't know if there's ever been an elevator. It's just a hole with some safety tape. Doesn't seem very safe.,,
,,Hume,,1,,Soup,Soup is nice. It reminds me of my childhood. Bertrand makes good soup. He keeps a bunch of ingredients in the pantry.,,Pantry
,,Hume,,1,,Statuette,"Rene has a statuette of a man in his office. He seems very proud of it. I wanted to ask what it was about, but it seemed rude to. Is that weird?",,
,,Hume,,3,,Office,"Rene called me to his office, and I found him standing over Locke's body. He said Locke had been snooping at the computer. There was blood pooling on the floor. I didn't know what to do. I don't know know how to deal with stuff like this. I just want to work on machines. Why did all this have to happen?",,Computer
,,Hume,,1,,Lucid ghosts,"I've seen a lucid ghost before, when I went to the cemetery to visit my mom's grave. There was a bottler who was talking to a ghost near one of the mausoleums. It was fascinating to see the understanding come to the ghost's eyes. Then they just faded away.",,
,,Hume,,1,,Computer,"We have a computer in the workshop to monitor readings from the GRAPS. It crashes a lot. It would be great to get a new one, but I'm too scared to ask Rene. He doesn't like it when we ask him to buy things.",,GRAPS
,,Hume,,1,,Company,"Descartes Power is a pretty good company to work for. I wish I got paid a bit more, but I'm not one for complaining.",,
,,Hume,,1,,Mop,"The one Immanuel has? It has a face. It's so cute! I told my kids about it, and they demanded I take a picture of it for them, but I never found a good opportunity. ",,
,,Hume,,3,,Back of the head,"Locke had a big, bloody wound on the back of his head. We wrapped him up in garbage bags. It was horrible. ",,
,,Hume,,1,,Poison,Bertrand has some rat poison in the pantry. It doesn't seem very safe to store it so close to the rest of the food. What if he accidentally picks up the poison instead of salt?,,Pantry
,,Hume,,1,,Mother,"My mom died when I was nine. People tell me that she passed on to the next life, but I never saw her ghost. Guess they didn't want me to get scared. Too bad how I turned out anyway, huh?",,
,,Hume,,3,,Traces of blood,"We spent some time trying to clean up the blood from where Locke fell, but it didn't really come out. I've never seen Rene look so shaken. I couldn't get the image of Locke's body lying there out of my head. My hands were shaking the entire time.",,
,,Hume,,5,,Protect,Things have gone so wrong. And I can't stop thinking about my family. What's going to happen to them now that I'm gone? Someone has to protect them.,,
,,Hume,,1,,Update,Progress on the GRAPS is going well. We're a bit ahead of schedule. Why? Has someone complained? Do they need it done faster?,,GRAPS
,,Hume,,1,,Exposed spectral energy,"We've had to leave a part of the GRAPS open in the front, which exposes a lot of spectral energy. It's a bit hazard, but the alternative is to keep adding and removing it as we need to get in there, and Rene's schedule makes that impossible. Rousseau agreed that going so fast is dangerous, but I don't want to bring it up with Rene if I don't have a good alternative plan.",,
,,Hume,,1,,Taser,"I took the gun from the security office, and Rousseau took the taser. I wonder if it protected them? I hope so.",,
,,Hume,,1,,Lunch,"I used to bring sandwiches in for lunch, but then they brought Bertrand in, and I can eat a lot more variety. It's nice, but I don't want to get used to it.",,
,,Hume,,7,,Resignation,"If you see this, something has gone wrong. Sorry.",,
,,Hume,,1,,Birdie,Like golf? I don't play sports. Too many books to read.,,
,,Hume,,1,,Watercolor,"My daughter likes to paint stuff, and Rousseau bought her some watercolor paint. Isn't that nice?",,
,,Hume,,1,,Leftovers,"Did Bertrand say something? I don't want him to think I don't like his food. It's just because I eat breakfast with my family in the mornings, and his portions are so big. Oh, I hope he's not mad.",,
,,Hume,,1,,Hologram,My kids complain a lot about not being able to hologram their friends. But we don't have enough money to justify buying a hologram projector right now. Maybe we'll get a bonus when we finish this project.,,
,,Hume,,1,,Employee of the month,What? I don't want to be employee of the month. I don't want people looking at me.,,
,,Hume,,1,,Pantry,"There's all kinds of delicious things in the pantry, but Bertrand doesn't like it if people go in there unaccompanied.",,
,,Hume,,1,,Bathroom stall,"Immanuel insists the furthest bathroom stall is out of order, but I'm sure I've seen him go in there. I don't want to bother him about it though.",,
,,Immanuel,Confused answer 1,0,,When given a keyword they can't yet give an answer to,"... Ask what Watson thinks. He has great ideas. Oh, he has his head in a bucket most of the time, but when he surfaces, thoughts like soap bubbles. I'm telling you: shiny, fleeting brilliance.... ",,
,,Immanuel,Confused answer 2,0,,When given a keyword they can't yet give an answer to,"... Chilly in here, isn't it? It's the air conditioning. They want us sleepy. Docile... ",,
,,Immanuel,Confused answer 3,0,,When given a keyword they can't yet give an answer to,"... Out, damned spot! Watson! ...",,
,,Immanuel,Name,0,Y,Immanuel,"It's Immanuel, but... brawk! Don't go spreading it around. Descartes has planted snakes in the pipes. I heard they've been outfitted with mics, non-stick collars so they don't go sliding off as they inch around and peek through the grates. Orders straight from the top, I heard, but I doubt even Rene knows about it. This goes deep.",,
,,Immanuel,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,0,,Lucid0,Brawk! No voices in my head. Go before they bug you in your sleep.,,
,,Immanuel,,1,,Rene,"Mr Descartes is the boss around here. The way he recites the corporate handbook, I don't think he's ever had an original thought. But maybe that's it! He's an android. Watson! We've got to write this down.",,
,,Immanuel,,1,,Rousseau,"The ghost tech? They seem nice enough, but they're hiding something. Maybe those safety goggles of theirs are projecting a script. Maybe instructions. I should take a look... ",,
,,Immanuel,,1,,Locke,"The ""security"" guard around here. Tell you something, there's only one thing he's protecting around here, and that's the GRAPS.",,GRAPS
,,Immanuel,,1,,Bertrand,"If there's anything nice about anyone here, it's Bertrand. He makes a daily grain loaf with lots of seeds. Sometimes, he decorates my plate with edible flowers. Still, he seems too eager to please. He's trying too hard to get me on his side. But to what end?",,
,,Immanuel,1st lie: I don't believe anyone. ,1,Y,Bathroom stall,"I'm the only one here who can see through the web of lies, the only one not bugged. It's taken me months to piece it together, but all the main players, the engineers, the manager of this facility, they're controlled through ear pieces and microchips, thoughts fed straight to their synapses. It's like talking to a bunch of flightless drones. That's why why I didn't believe the boss when he took me aside with Bertrand, the cook. Me, Watson, and Bertrand, we're the only ones unimportant enough to be free of the network. The boss showed us footage of two GRAPS employees—the ghost tech and head engineer—collecting guns from the security office. I didn't believe the boss for a second. All of the security footage around here goes through a red-light filter that removes all signs of corporate espionage. He must have bypassed the filter somehow and showed us exactly what he wanted. ",,GRAPS

,,Immanuel,1st lie confrontation: I believed Rene. ,2,Y,Employee of the month,"You're right, I believed him, the boss. That plaque made me proud of my work. Soft. He must have planted it weeks in advance. The web is so complex, even I get confused sometimes. But in my defense, the video he showed us was convincing. It's hard to fake a video so quickly. Takes a long time to send data all the way to corporate. I've looked at the surveillance wiring and checked the footage at night when Locke steps out of his office. Brawk—I suppose he's dead now. ",,
,,Immanuel,Appears when using interact button without keyword. Varies with ludcidity level.,2,,Lucid2,He said I was doing important work. That's what I've been saying all along. And the plating was so shiny.,,
,,Immanuel,2nd lie: I'm still alive,3,Y,GRAPS,"Grawp! The device? It was built to suck souls from living people on other planets. They say the energy is harvested from the ghost fields, but there aren't enough illucid ghosts left to power the machines we have. Corporations are greedy. You think the dead planets are a coincidence? There will be another extinction event, just wait. But no one believes me. At least... no, Rousseau, the ghost tech, did. After the boss showed me the video of them and Hume stealing guns, I went to confront Rousseau. That's when they confirmed it, the device's true purpose. Rousseau must have removed their chip somehow, unplugged. They're in the real world as much as me. I wonder if Hume is unplugged too.",,Extinction event

,,Immanuel,"2nd lie confrontation: I'm dead, and so is Hume.",4,Y,Hume,"That's right. Hume is dead. How did I forget? Am I telling myself lies? How deep does this conspiracy go if I'm also affected? I thought I was the only one who could see through it, see the spidery lines. But ... oh. When Rousseau and I went to stop the boss before he could activate the device, we found Hume's body in the boss's office. That's when I realized the boss was part of the conspiracy all along. I believed him, got fooled by the video footage. Nothing usually gets past me. But Hume's body shocked me. When we ran, the boss pulled out a gun, my body wrenching back, uniform blooming with blood and... that's it. I'm dead, aren't I?",,

She walked out like I meant nothing. She was brainwashed by the paint fumes in her watercolor set. They had these calming, horrible names, making her want to be somewhere else: serenity, woodsman, citrine, alabaster. She was doomed the moment her brush hit the canvas.",,

But I realize now it was about control. Over the world around me, over myself. I refused to listen to anyone's opinion but my own. That's why she left. Birdie. She wanted me to look beyond my own beak. To listen to what she wanted. I was so squawking self-centered. Now I'm more alone than I've ever been. If you have someone, pay attention.

It paid well, and it allowed me to do the stuff I liked doing. I had free reign. Good working conditions. But I resigned after a year. I just... I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't live with myself knowing that we're processing people on the verge of passing to the next life. I promised myself that I would never compromise on that moving forward. But then times got tough, and Descartes Power was hiring. I convinced myself that it would make life better for the people of Aris. I compromised again. Maybe... maybe I can be better in the next life, if I even deserve to go there.",,

,,Rousseau,,1,,GRAPS,"The GRAPS, or Ghost Retrieval And Processing System, promises to be quite beneficial for Aris. We don't have many bottlers this far out on the periphery. I've been putting together the sensitive spectral components while Hume works on the mechanical parts. Descartes clearly didn't spare any expense on it. The bandwidth for the spectral energy is probably more than we'll ever need.",,
,,Rousseau,,3,,Office,"We were going to find Hume and confront Rene, but by the time we got to Rene's office, it was already too late. Hume was lying on the ground, motionless. I just froze. Gave Rene enough time to start shooting. I can't believe she's gone...",,
,,Rousseau,,1,,Computer,Computers are great. I've helped build a few. They run on a Banshee-87 battery system. One illucid ghost every year is generally good enough to keep a low-end one running for a long time.,,

,,Rousseau,,3,,Extinction event,"While Hume went to tell Rene that she'd killed me, I went to the workshop to dismantle the device. But it was locked down. Immanuel was there, waiting for me. He demanded to know if I was part of some or other conspiracy. I decided to tell him what I knew about the device, about the design flaws and what it could do. He got real excited and took me to the boarded up bathroom stall, where he's put up a variety of newspaper clippings and evidence. He told me about the extinction events that had happened where Descartes had built facilities before. That's when I realised that it might not be a flaw at all.",,Bathroom stall

,,Rousseau,,5,,Mother,"I don't really remember my mom. She was around more than my dad, but it's like I can't even remember her face. I kept myself company most of the time growing up. Didn't really make friends. It was a hard time for me. But on the bright side, I had a lot of free time to learn how spectral physics work. Which allowed me to get a job and live on my own terms when I was fifteen. I don't resent my parents though. They did the best they could manage.",,
,,Rousseau,,5,,Traces of blood,"Blood on my jacket. From where I was shot. Immanuel was lying on the ground. I shouldn't have left him there. But I was too scared. Scared of dying, but more scared of the GRAPS activating and causing everyone on Aris to die. I couldn't let that happen. I took the long way around to the workshop, so Rene wouldn't have a shot at me until I got there. Somehow I still made it there before him, but I knew he'd come.",,
,,Rousseau,,3,,Protect,"What's going to happen to Hume's family? They were already struggling finanacially with Hume working full time. Now that she's... now that she's gone, they'll be in trouble. I have to protect them. Somehow.",,

,,Rousseau,,3,,Bathroom stall,"There's one that's out of order that Immanuel converted into some kind of hideaway for himself. It's filled with clippings and red string. He says it's mapping the connections between events and people, illuminating the conspiracies all around us. I didn't take it seriously until the moment the things Hume told me clicked into place with Immanuel's stories. Something was definitely going on.",,
