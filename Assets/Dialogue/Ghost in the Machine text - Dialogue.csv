,,Hume,Confused answer 1,0,,When given a keyword they can't yet give an answer to,... The actuator is faulty. We'll have to replace it...,,

,,Hume,Confused answer 3,0,,When given a keyword they can't yet give an answer to,"... Watch your hands, that's pure spectral energy. It'll fry you inside out...",,
,,Hume,,0,Y,Hume,"I'm Hume, the engineer. I work on designs and stuff. Rousseau helps me with the spectral side of things. As a person, I like to think of myself as dependable.",,

,,Hume,1st lie: The machine I helped build is safe and good,1,Y,GRAPS,"The Ghost Retrieval And Processing System. It's state of the art. It detects illucid ghosts and retrieves them from a distance. It's safer than sending people to bottle them, and it's faster. I'm pretty proud I played a part in setting it up here on Aris. It's safe and the design makes sense.",,
,,Hume,1st lie confrontation,2,Y,Extinction event,"Something was off with the GRAPS. They said it would identify and target illucid ghosts, but there's no functionality for that. It looked like it just does it indiscriminately. And the batteries were massive. Way too big for the number of ghosts that are likely to appear on Aris in a hundred years. It's like Descartes Power was expecting some kind of extinction event. Or they weren't waiting for people to die first. What was I building? Should I tell Rene? What if he's mad? I didn't know what to do.",,
,,Hume,2nd lie: I am still alive,3,Y,Filing cabinet,"Rousseau and I split up after I told them everything. I went to find Rene, to tell him that I killed Rousseau, like he asked. I knocked on the open door, and told him. Straight face, no sweating. I was weirdly calm. He seemed relieved, but still a bit jumpy. When I turned to go find Rousseau and help them destroy the GRAPS, I hit my elbow on the file cabinet, hard. So hard there was blood. Ow. Rene nearly leapt from his seat. I laughed it off and hurried to the workshop.",,
,,Hume,2nd lie confrontation,4,Y,Broken door,"Rene had locked the door when I got there. Somehow, he'd found out that I hadn't killed Rousseau. I didn't even think of breaking in, but then he started yelling. Saying that he was calling the Aris bank. That he'd make sure they tossed my family into the street. I just saw red. I broke the door down and pulled out the gun. I was going to kill him. Descartes Power was a big corporation. They could do stuff like throw people out of their homes. I couldn't let that happen. But I hesitated, and then suddenly Bertrand was there. He must have heard me bash through the door. He tried to take the gun from me and we stumbled into the filing cabinet. There was a searing pain on the side of my head for a split second. Then there was nothing. I guess that means I'm dead.",,
,,Hume,3rd lie: It's okay to do bad things to keep my family safe,5,Y,Tickets,"When I asked Rene about the GRAPS, he got very angry. I just stood there. He said that my family would die, even if I told people. There was no stopping it. The GRAPS would be activated no matter what. But if I stayed quiet, he would get me and my family out. I agreed. I agreed to let everyone else die because I love my family. They're all I have, and they're the ones that depend on me, not everyone else. I have to look out for them, even if it means hurting other people. A day later, we had tickets off-planet for the date of the GRAPS activation.",,
,,Hume,3rd lie confrontation,6,Y,Brother,"Me and Rousseau go way back. When they came to Aris, they came alone. We worked on some jobs together and we became friends. They came over for dinner. They played with my kids. We used to have beers after work in this pub on the south end of town. They told me that I was like the brother they never had. I laughed it off, but I felt it too. They were family. And I depended on them as much as they depended on me. I could talk to them about work, and about how worried I was about my finances. Stuff I couldn't tell anyone else. And I would have just left them behind. That's not right. It's not.",,

,,Locke,,1,,Immanuel,,,
,,Locke,1st lie: I'm still alive.,1,Y,Statuette,"He jumped me when I left his office. What was he thinkin'? What could a scrawny little guy like that do to a guy like me? No one with a tie that fancy should get into it with anyone. He should be glad I didn't beat him to a pulp for that. But I felt sorry for the guy, so I let him go. I think he's learned his lesson. I'll have another talk with him later to make sure he's got the message.",,
,,Locke,1st lie confrontation,2,Y,Traces of blood,"I was so sure he'd just stand there, cowering, like people always do. He didn't have a chance against me. But he whacked me with something heavy. I hit the floor, hard, and I could feel the blood flow over my face and onto the floor. I looked at it. It was so red. That was me. My life. It left me. I'm dead. Damn it!",,
,,Locke,2nd lie: I got jumped for no reason.,3,Y,Office,"It came outta nowhere. Rene's eyes were wildly goin' back and forth, like he was lookin' for a way out. I was the security guard, there to protect him. Why'd he attack me? He just went mad, no rhyme or reason. Must have gone crazy. ",,
,,Locke,2nd lie confrontation,4,Y,Computer,I was at the computer when he came in. I saw the email. Said he was gonna lock everyone else inside and evacuate. Somethin' bad was gonna go down. I told him to let me go. Shoulda known that wouldn't fly. Stupid. Shoulda seen it comin'.,,
,,Locke,3rd lie: I'm an upstanding citizen -- I protect people,5,Y,Protect,"Protect, that's what security officers do. I spent my life protecting others, and I got hit in the back of the head because I saw something I shouldn't have. What a bummer. Who's gonna protect these people now that I'm gone? Damn. At least I did good up until now.",,
,,Locke,3rd lie confrontation,6,Y,Update,"They wanted me to update them all the time. It was so much pressure. The security job, that was just a show. I never protected anyone, not since I started workin' for Splinter Energy Corp. It's all a sham. I wasn't protectin' anyone. I was gonna leave the others behind if Rene had let me. Damn it! Why did I even get into this line of work anyway? Money ain't worth this. ",,

,,Rene,Confused answer 1,0,,When given a keyword they can't yet give an answer to,... Production must be kept on schedule. No more delays! Production...,,
,,Rene,Confused answer 2,0,,When given a keyword they can't yet give an answer to,"... They're wasting time, taking breaks. How can we be efficient like this?...",,
,,Rene,Confused answer 3,0,,When given a keyword they can't yet give an answer to,... The employee agreement section 3 subsection 5 clearly states that every minute you're late gets subtracted from your paycheck! ...,,
,,Rene,Name,0,Y,Rene,"I am first and foremost an employee of the great corporation Decartes Power. I am Rene, Executive Senior Corporate Production Manager. I have done everything possible to resolve the situation peacefully. I followed all the company rules as far as I could. The chaos that ensued... it was out of my control.",,

,,Rene,,1,,Locke,,,
,,Rene,,1,,Bertrand,,,
,,Rene,,1,,Immanuel,,,
,,Rene,1st lie: I killed Locke because I had to -- he was attacking me.,1,Y,Statuette,"If only he hadn't been so aggressive. I would have let him go. Section 43 of the employee handbook, subsection 3, paragraph 3.2, clearly states that ""when your life is threatened by another, you may spend up to 5 (five) minutes to defend yourself with deadly force."" I followed the rules. He was trying to kill me, so I had no choice. I hit him with the statuette of my father.",,
,,Rene,1st lie confrontation,2,Y,Back of the head,"Locke saw the email about the evacuation. I panicked. He threatened to tell the other employees about it if I didn't let him leave the facility. I was shocked. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't just let him walk out. So when he turned his back to leave my office, I grabbed the statuette of my father and hit him over the head. I... I killed him. Just like that. There was nothing in the employee handbook about what to do when you kill someone. What else could I do?",,
,,Rene,2nd lie: I'm still alive,3,Y,Soup,"I've never met anyone else who made soup like my mother. But Bertrand pulls it off somehow. I ate some when all the chaos finally ended, and it brought me back to good memories. We used to sit around the table and father would tell us about his day at work, and how excited he is to bring his sons into the business. I haven't eaten at the same table as him for a long time. Perhaps I'll put in some leave later this week, once I've finished the last of the reports. It would be nice to see mother again.",,
,,Rene,2nd lie confrontation,4,Y,Poison,"It tasted funny, the soup. Some kind of acidity. At first, I thought it was just the blood in my mouth from where Rousseau had hit me. But then I felt it in my stomach. I felt it burn my throat. And then I remembered what Bertrand had said. ""Don't eat the soup."" He must have poisoned it. I can't believe it. I'm dead. I'm really dead.",,
,,Rene,3rd lie: Company is the most important thing in the world,5,Y,Company,"I'm a company man, just like my father. Died on the job, just like my grandfather. A company man. Serving one's company is the noblest pursuit and I am proud of what I chose to do. There's nothing I want to take back. No other choices I would have made. I regret nothing. I am a company man, through and through.",,
,,Rene,3rd lie confrontation,6,Y,Mother,"The company will notify mother and father of my death, eventually. Mother will be devastated. Why couldn't I just answer her phone calls? I know the employee handbook says ""no personal phone calls during work hours"", but she's my mother. It makes no sense to put the company first. I'll be replaced in a day at Descartes Power, but what will my mother do? I... I'm sorry, mother. I hope I find you again in the next life.",,
